\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
The harmonic motion of a spring can be seen in many objects and machines around us such as a rubber band or a guitar. Using and understanding these equations we can simulate the motion of a spring close to perfection. This motion can be simulated using derivatives and limits. For a more simple simulation we can estimate and approximate the motion of a spring using some simple equations. However, this is quite inaccurate and not reliable.

\section{Implementation}\label{sec:intro}
Every set time t we calculate the position and velocity of the spring. This does not take into consideration the loss of energy and thus it is extremely inaccurate.
